# AI Integration Patterns Cursorrules

## Project Purpose

This cursorrules file provides guidelines and best practices for integrating AI models and services into applications. It covers patterns for effective AI integration, prompt engineering, model selection, and handling AI-specific challenges.

## Technology Stack

- OpenAI API (GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Vision)
- Claude API (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain/LlamaIndex for orchestration
- Embedding models (text-embedding-3-large, etc.)
- Vector databases (PostgreSQL + pgvector, Pinecone, Qdrant)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## Integration Patterns

### Prompt Engineering

- Use clear, specific instructions in prompts
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Provide examples for few-shot learning
- Use system messages to define AI's role and constraints
- Implement proper input validation before sending to AI
- Use conversation history for context preservation

### Model Selection

- Choose models based on task complexity and requirements
- Use cheaper, faster models for simple tasks
- Reserve more capable models for complex reasoning
- Consider latency, cost, and quality tradeoffs
- Implement fallback mechanisms for model API failures

### RAG Implementation

- Create high-quality embeddings from source documents
- Implement proper chunking strategies for text
- Use semantic search to retrieve relevant context
- Include metadata with chunks for better filtering
- Implement hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Use re-ranking to improve result quality

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

- Break complex problems into step-by-step reasoning
- Provide intermediate outputs for verification
- Implement validation for each reasoning step
- Use structured output formats (JSON, XML) for easier parsing
- Allow human-in-the-loop verification for critical decisions

## AI System Architecture

- Implement proper API client with retries and error handling
- Use streaming for real-time responses
- Implement caching for expensive model calls
- Set up proper rate limiting and queueing
- Use webhooks for long-running tasks
- Implement proper logging for model inputs and outputs

## Security and Privacy

- Implement proper data sanitization before sending to AI
- Use data minimization principles
- Implement PII detection and redaction
- Set up proper access controls for AI capabilities
- Audit and log all AI interactions
- Implement prompt injection protections

## Performance Optimization

- Batch requests when possible
- Optimize token usage in prompts
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use parallelization for independent AI tasks
- Optimize embedding generation and storage

## Evaluation and Testing

- Implement comprehensive evaluation suites
- Use human evaluation for subjective tasks
- Compare multiple models on benchmark datasets
- Test with adversarial inputs
- Continuously monitor model performance

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Use fallback strategies for failed AI requests
- Set appropriate timeouts for API calls
- Implement graceful degradation of AI features
- Provide user-friendly error messages

## Ethical Considerations

- Implement content filtering for inputs and outputs
- Provide transparency about AI use
- Avoid reinforcing biases or harmful stereotypes
- Consider environmental impact of model choices
- Implement human oversight for sensitive applications

## Best Practices

- Start with simpler models and scale up as needed
- Maintain a prompt library for reusable patterns
- Log and version prompts for reproducibility
- Implement proper testing for AI-powered features
- Use structured formats for reliable parsing
- Consider using tool augmentation for specialized tasks
